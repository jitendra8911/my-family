Outer Banks - Atlantic Ocean
<!--more-->
Me, my brother and mom drove from Greensboro, North Carolina, all the way to Outer Banks which are islands off the coast of North Carolina, separating the Atlantic Ocean from the mainland.
The original intent of the visit was to get a view of our stunning Milky way galaxy in the darkest skies of all the East Coast. 

So we reached Outerbanks around midnight, wasted no time to freshup in the hotel and rush towards the shores of the Atlantic Ocean and watch Milky way galaxy.
We went so close to the shore that we could hear the huge sound of waves and saw one of the lighthouses of the ocean. 

Unfortunately, it was overcast that night, so we couldn't get a clear view of milky way galaxy, but was able to see a glimpse of it. We tried to capture in
the camera, but it was so dark that it wasn't captured properly. Nevertheless, we had great time that night!!

The picture shown above is taken in the midnight nearby ocean shores when we went to watch milky way galaxy.

The next day, we woke up early and went to nearby beach to enjoy the fresh air, pleasant sound and beautiful view of the ocean. We thoroughly enjoyed each and every minute we spent there.
In the afternoon we had pizza for lunch, probably the first time mom had pizza after coming to US.

The tour to Outer Banks wouldn't be complete without watching Wright Brothers National Memorial. Wright Brothers tested their first flight in the town of Kitty Hawk
located on the Outer Banks of North Carolina. In celebrating Wright Brother's success and honoring their work, Wright Brothers National Memorial was built
in Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina. We enjoyed the experience of visiting the memorial and learning about Wright Brothers and their inventions.

By the time we are done, it was probably in the afternoon, we took off to Greensboro.

I consider this as the best tour I have taken in my life so far.
