Lovely Ammamma!!

She was such a great person whom we all miss for sure! In my opinion she was the best cook in the world. Her dishes were world class and would be hard to find that taste
anywhere else. She was a kindhearted person and was friendly to anyone around her regardless of who or where they came from. 

She was a very talkative person and never hesitated to break ice when there was silence in the room. Whenever I spoke to her over a call or by paying visits to her place, I obtained wealth of information
about my mom's and dad's family which I otherwise would not have known.

It was incredible and very hard to fathom how she brought up 4 children (one of them being my mom) and also manage household tasks at the same time. She left so many sweet memories
that she shared with all her children and grand children.
