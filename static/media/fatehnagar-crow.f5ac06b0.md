Fatehnagar crow incident
<!--more-->
When I was a kid about 2 years old, I used to divert the complaint made by house owner on me (in a light-hearted way) by pointing to crow. It all started when
I plucked the flowers from the plant that belonged to the landlord, a lady who was about 35 years old around that time. When my mom was around holding me, landlord used to
exchange some funny banters with me for plucking the flowers.

Being so tiny, and babbling words that come out of my mouth, I had no other option to defend my actions, so I used to divert my landlord's attention her by pointing to
cawing crow. She was astonished by my intelligence to divert a topic at that very little age.

Since this happened when I was 2 years old, I hardly remember any of these scenes. But when mom relives those memories and shares it with me,
it feels like I am able to recollect few pictures, sit back and laugh at my actions!!
