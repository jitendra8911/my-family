Chicago trip
<!--more-->
It was in September 2017, when mom landed in US, travelling outside India for the first time in her life.

I took my mom to Chicago on my birthday September 11, 2017 and on the following day. It was a memorable birthday to me having mom by my side and spending valuable and quality time with her.

On the first day we visited Navy Pier, sat nearby Navy Pier view and had erra ravva upma for lunch, then we headed to take chicago boat tour witnessing a range of buildings from oldest to the newest constructions,
learning Chicago's history and finally finishing the day by visiting Willis tower skydeck. Accepting to visit skydeck was an adventurous feet my mom took. No doubt we had a breathtaking view of Chicago all the way from the top which is at 1,353 feet in the air
and situated at 103rd floor of Willi's tower, but nevertheless those were some tense moments fearing for height, but in the end my mom pulled it off as she always does!!

On the second day, I took my mom back to Chicago, this time visiting Adler Planetarium which is America's first planetarium. If I recall correctly, we saw a short movie on the study of stars, constellations in particular.
After finishing the first visit, we rested nearby it where there was plenty of seating area and had our lunch. I guess we had bread and omelette for lunch. From there we went to nearby shore of 
Lake Michigan. We got some memorable pics capture, out of which one of them you see in this page at the top. From there, we went to Chicago bean, got some clicks and finally to Millennium Park
to witness beautiful gardens and incredible view of the city.
