He is one of my role models. He is an epitome of hard work, sincerity, discipline and love towards children and his grandchildren. In
these days it is hard to find all these qualities packaged together in a single person. Fortunately or unfortunately his association spanned
a very small community, i.e, colleagues, friends, relatives and family. I always had a feeling if he was known to the entire world, he would
have become a celebrity. 

One thing that I liked more about him, and I think that young generation can draw inspiration from is that he made use of evey second effectively.
I never saw his sitting idle. If he finds time outside his office work, he engages himself into things like updating his ledger, rolling up a jute twine (which I described in detail in moments section),
gardening plants, reading news-paper, repairing any broken things at house etc.

As a grandchild, I have very sweet memories shared with him like walking with him to the post office, going to sweet shop for buying my favorite sweet palakova, 
buying household needs like meat, vegetables and fruits, sitting together in the balcony and patio. His wishing style was very special and unique.
Phrases like "God Bless You", "All The Best", "Chiranjeevi chiranjeevi sukhibhava sukhibava", "achha achha" among many others that he used would bring us
endless joy and happiness on our faces. The way how he pampered his baby grandchildren by giving countless hugs and kisses mesmerizes everyone around. His kind letters
wishing well-being of all of us are written with lots of love and affection.
