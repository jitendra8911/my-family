Avakayi pachidi!!
<!--more-->
Eating the freshly made pickle with hot rice and a spoon or two of ghee
is heavenly.

There were times when I was at ammamma's house when she was packing pickles for all of her family, including us, from the avakaya jaadi
which I will cherish forever. Looking at the scene of a scoop of avakayi pachadi which is as red as a glowing sun, floating in the healthy sesame oil
coming out of the jaadi makes me forget about all my worries and enjoy the moment.
