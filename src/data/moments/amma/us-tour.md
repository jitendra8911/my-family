US tour!!!
<!--more-->

### Flight landed. Here she comes!!
This was one of the most cherishing, adventurous and memorable tour my mom took that we all celebrated and going to remember it for rest of our lives!!

My mom landed in US on September 9th 2017 in Chicago airport. I have been waiting for this moment for very long time. I was so excited that I drove to airport terminal 5
to receive her well in advance. I was anxiously waiting to receive her at the International arrivals nearby conveyor belt. 

And then she comes looking very tiny from far, I went to her and hugged, tears of joy started pouring in. Once we came to consciousness, my mom's first question was how come 
I became so thin!! We kept on talking, and were over the moon relishing those moments of meeting each other after very long time.

### Naperville and Chicago
Then we headed to Naperville, TGM apartments the place where I lived back then. Although I relocated to different places after that, I came back to live in TGM.
During her first few days in Naperville, I took her to Naperville's The Morton Arboretum which is a public garden located in Lisle, that has picturesque greenery and walking trails.
I then took her to Chicago covering places such as Navy Pier, Chicago boat tour, Planetarium, Chicago Bean, Millennium Park, Willi's Tower Skydeck.
There is another article in this blog where I explained solely about the pleasant and wonderful experience I had taking my mom to Chicago.

Some time during the week went to Balaji tempus, which is a popular temple in Naperville. Although the temples in US are not the closest match to those in India,
this one is a decent one and is spacious. Mom also made some friends in the temple. Especially I remember, that my mom played with kids of a couple of devotees.
There were some benches outside the temple in the garden, where we sat around for sometime and chatted for a bit.


### Off to Greensboro!!
Then we headed to Greensboro, to visit my brother. It was also the first time for my brother meeting my mom after many years. When we landed in the airport,
we knew that taking few steps from the gate will lead us to airport's entrance since it was relatively a small airport. Me and my mom were anxiously waiting to meet my brother.
So was my brother. He reached the entrance on time. As soon as my mom and brother hugged each other, tears of joy started to come. Once those moments sunk down gradually,
we took off to my brother's apartment. On the way, we took a halt at a mini Walmart. We bought some eggs, milks and probably some veggies.


### Outer Banks
In the next few days, we took an adventurous tour to Outer Banks. It is undoubtedly the best tour that I have ever taken in my life. I have explained about my experience
in another exclusive Outer Banks article.


### North Carolina Zoo
So after the tour, I had to return to Naperville, to get back to work. Meanwhile, mom visited beautiful parks in Greensboro which is well known for greenery.
She also went visited world's largest natural habitat zoo, North Carolina Zoo and was able to witness wide range of birds, animals and plants. She really enjoyed the trip.

### Whitewater falls
I went back to Greensboro in November 2017 and this time we all went to another adventurous tour, this time to Whitewater Falls in North Carolina.
One of the highlights of the trip was that, in order to reach the whitewater falls, we have to hike for more than a mile. The hiking path was mesmerizing with full of trees and bushes all the way on both sides of the path.
We also rested at one place where there were giant stones separated by water flowing between them. Another highlights of the trip was this my mom made friends
with a batch of American women who were coming from different state and who were all part of a yoga group. My mom took a picture with them. These little moments are very precious to my mom.

### Tour de University of North Carolina at Charlotte
After we came back from the whitewater falls, we went to visit my University where I pursued my Masters which is University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
I have shown my mom all the places I have been to in the University including, College of Computing and Informatics, Student Union Center, Library, Canteen facilities, etc.
I took her to classrooms where I attended and gave her a glimpse of how big and sophisticated they are.

During my trip to Greensboro, we also went to famous parks in Greensboro and thoroughly enjoyed the nature. We loved those walks. They were pretty awesome and surrounded by beautiful flowers and plants everywhere.

### LFG
My brother took us to his office, Lincoln Financial Group, situated in Greensboro downtown, the tallest building in Greensboro. His office lobby was decorated
with Christmas tree as center of attraction. We went to my brother's cabin space and shown my mom on how does it feel like working from the cubicle.

### Brother and Mom farewell time
It was time for my brother to bid adieu to my mom. My mom was going to come with me back to Naperville. Her return flight was scheduled for departure from Chicago.
The day before we flew back to Naperville, we all wore Hackathon tee shirts that I have got for taking part in a n Hackathon while I was working for a project at Uptake.
The pic we took in front of my brother's house all wearing same tee shirt is stored deep inside my memory that I will never forget.

It is the farewell time, and my mom and brother has to say goodbye to each other, before they both can see each other after few more years. It is a tough period of time.

### Back to Naperville
We flew back to Naperville, and this time since it was beginning of harsh winter, my mom had to wear layers of jackets to protect from cold. She had another 2 weeks or so before
her flight back to India. I made use of this time to the fullest extent possible by asking her to prepare my favourite dishes. She prepared dishes such as
garelu, payasam, chapthi with chole, egg fry, chicken curry, biryani, dahi vada, dosa with green coconut chutney. The last dish I mentioned has a story to it.
So I asked my mom how come coconut chutney that she prepares sometimes turn out to be green, and boom, she prepared the coconut chutney that I was talking about on that moment!!

### Grocery Shopping
I took here to grocery stores such as Target, Walmart, Costco and Cermak Fresh Market among others. Most notable one was Costco. She liked few winter jackets
in the store that were light weight and thought those will be very helpful to my dad to protect from cold weather during winter times in India. She was astonished
by looking at the size of shelves and how much grocery items they can contain at Costco and other big grocery stores. She was awestruck by looking at the fresh spinach
that was sold in Cermak and pointed out that it is tough to get such type of quality of produce in India.

### Previously lived apartment
I have also shown my previous apartment to my mom where I used to live which is in Addison of Naperville. Since it was damn cold, we haven't spent too much time
hanging around the building. The buildings outside doors were also fob key protected, so there was no way for me to take her inside the building. I have also shown her
the empty golf area behind our building which used to be a common background in video calls when I spoke to them.

### Farewell time for me and mom
It was time for me to bid adieu to my mom. We started packing luggage a day or two before her departure. We took plenty of pictures, and the one that I remember
is inside the car where we two holding each other. It was hard for me to digest the fact that she is soon going to leave the country, and tried to make most of her
remaining period of stay.

The day before she was going to leave, it snowed. That was the first snow of the winter in Naperville, and what more, the first
snow my mom has ever seen!! She seemed to have enjoyed the snow and to my surprise, she was walking fast even in the snow. One scene which I remember is that
my mom went to dump the trash bag out in the snow, and she kept jogging all the way from home to garbage disposal and jogging back to home. She is a brave human being!!

### The day has come
And finally it was the day to leave. We left early to reach airport well in advance. Got her luggage checked in and got the boarding passes ready. I gave her one final hug.
I was controlling my emotions. I can see my mom started weeping, but I don't want to react, but instead stayed bravely and tried to give her courage. She went past the security check in
and waved her goodbye for one final time before she disappeared from my sight. I must admit that, I cried immediately after she left for about few minutes,
and after I came back to normal, I tried contacting my friend to connect me to my mom, who luckily was also travelling to India on the same day, and I saw him in the airport.

Once my mom mentioned that she reached the gate and was waiting for the flight, I started to make a move and get back to home. My mom prepared sufficient food for the rest of the week for me.
So I had chapathi and chicken in the afternoon and for the rest of the day I could not come out of void she left. It kept on haunting me for several days until it 
slowly sunk in.

At the time of this writing, I haven't met mom after that, and have been anxiously waiting for the right moment to go to India and visit my family.
