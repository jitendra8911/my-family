yummilicious crispy garelu

<!--more-->

The picture shows my mom preparing yummilicious crispy garelu on skewers on the occasion of vinayaka chavithi.

On the left stove is payasam, a sweet, 
which is known as Kheer in north India and as pudding worldwide. On the right are garelu, a donout shaped hot, that is prepared by frying chunks of batter
made up of soaked and blended urad dal, green chilies, diced onion, cumin seeds, vaamu (carom seeds powder) among others.

So every year we used to perform pooja on the occasion of vinayaka chavithi which falls between August and September. The rule is to not have food until the pooja is performed. But cooking can go simultaneously along with pooja.
Back in those days when I was in India, on the day of vinayaka chavithi, my mouth used to water from tha aroma of garelu especially when it is in the process of cooking and by looking the shape and color of it.

I used to wait for the moment when the pooja is completed, and when it's done I would not waste a second to go and attack the food, thoroughly enjoying and savouring each and every bite and used to lose track of the number
of garelu, keep on eating until I was full.

Given a chance, I would love to go back in time and relive those memorable moments. Trust me, there is nothing else that can bring me joy than enjoying eating hot garelu made by my mom.
After ammamma, my mom is the next best cook in the world!! After all she inherited those genes from my grand mom, so where will those skills go!!
