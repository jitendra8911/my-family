This is about lovely, cute and little angel/niece pravasthi!!

Being called as Uncle as one of the first few words spoken by the little angel is priceless. She always brings an aura of joyfulness, loving, and a feeling of
stress relief to people around her. Her words are gold, her voice is like that of nightingale, her smile is charming and here innocent shrewdness brings smiles to all of us.
