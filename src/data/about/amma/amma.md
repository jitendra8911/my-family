Undoubtedly my favorite person in the whole Universe. She is the most loving, charming, caring and hardworking
human being I am gifted by GOD. She is always there during all the times such as sharing my happiness, concerns, helping me to get through
challenges, encouraging me in all aspects of my life. She is the perfect epitome
of all the great qualities a person can have.
