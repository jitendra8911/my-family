My father!!

I go by calling him nana. It goes without saying that he is the only reason for bringing me, and my brother to whatever respectful positions we are in the 
professional field today. He was always there supporting not only financially but also encouraging us to pursue our field of interest in education.

There are countless number of memories that I share with him and will try my best to capture as many as I can remember.

I hope we share many more in the future and keep room for those priceless moments in this library.
