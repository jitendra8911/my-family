He is one of my role model. He is an epitome of hard work, sincerity, discipline and love towards children and his grandchildren. In
these days it is hard to find all these qualities packaged together in a single person. Fortunately or unfortunately his association spanned
a very small community, i.e, colleagues, friends, relatives and family. I always had a feeling if he was known to the entire world, he would
have become a celebrity. 

One thing that I liked more about him, and I think that young generation can draw inspiration from is that he made use of evey second effectively.
I never saw his sitting idle. If he finds time outside his office work, he engages into thing like updating his ledger, rolling up a jute twine (which I talked more in moments section),
gardening plants, reading news-paper, repairing any broken things at house etc.
